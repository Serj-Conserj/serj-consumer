# Serj Consumer

Serj Consumer is a FastAPI based service that acts as a voice bot for table reservations. It consumes booking tasks from RabbitMQ, fetches booking details from PostgreSQL, tries to book a table via the web parser and communicates with the customer through a WebSocket connection using speech-to-text and text-to-speech models.

## Web API

The application exposes a single WebSocket endpoint:

- `GET /ws` – exchange audio messages. The server pulls booking id from the queue and starts a conversation. Audio messages are sent and received as binary frames.

## Background tasks

On startup the service launches a background consumer for the `pars_queue`. Messages from this queue trigger the Selenium parser to try booking a table automatically. If successful, the booking status is reported back to the backend.

## Environment variables

The service expects the following variables to be defined (usually via a `.env` file):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | PostgreSQL username |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password |
| `POSTGRES_HOST` | PostgreSQL host |
| `PG_PORT` | PostgreSQL port |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `USERNAME_QUEUE` | RabbitMQ username |
| `PASSWORD_QUEUE` | RabbitMQ password |
| `RABBITMQ_HOST` | RabbitMQ host |
| `RABBITMQ_PORT` | RabbitMQ port |
| `BOOKING_SUCCESS_STATE` | Status string used when a booking succeeds |
| `BOOKING_FAILURE_STATE` | Status string used when a booking fails |
| `CALL_QUEUE` | Name of the queue with new calls |
| `PARS_QUEUE` | Name of the queue for parser tasks |
| `GROQ_TOKEN` | API token for the Groq LLM service |

At runtime `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false` is set automatically to avoid warnings from the transformers library.
